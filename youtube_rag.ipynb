video we have a combined fiveUniversity degrees now I value your timeso I'm going to very first briefly hiton some important points that you mustbe aware of when picking a laptop forschool then I'm going to get straightinto what you're actually here to seewhich is which laptops we recommend forvarious types of students firstly thelaptop should be small and portableunless we get hit by another virus whichwe all hope we don't students frequentlymove from classroom to classroom plusthey often have group projects wherethey meet in various locations no no onewants to Lug around a heavy Beast of amachine also when you have a laptop openin class you don't want to be the personwho blocks the view to the teacher andthe board for those sitting behind youbecause your laptop is large on the flipside you'll want a laptop that's largeenough to get real work done that meansyou want to see a good amount of contenton screen now you may think that alaptop screen size is what determineshow much content you can see and it is akey factor but size as you know isn'teverything there are two other factorsthat determine this the first is theclarity of the screen which isdetermined by how many pixels it has toprecisely display content and the secondis how bright the screen is thereforestudents should ideally get a 14 inchlaptop with a resolution higher than1920x1200 and a screen brighter than 400nits which will also help you see thescreen in a bright environment likeusing it close to a window and schoolstend to have lots of Windows if you doneed to compromise on one of thesefactors you will survive with only a1920x1200 resolution display we have twoDell XPS 13 plus laptops in the studio ahigh resolution one and one with asubstantially lower resolution displaywe found that you'll

sales where their pricesdrop by several hundred dollars for thestudents who like to game one laptopreally stands out it's the Asus G14 Iknow this laptop really well Ipersonally bought one last year and usedit a ton I then upgraded to this year'smodel the G14 is incredibly powerful forits size and can be had with a varietyof different high-powered Graphics rightup to the RTX 4080 although I find theRTX 4060 model is really The Sweet Spotin terms of price to Performance and onpricing it's really reasonable for whatyou get especially if you buy it on asale and it regularly goes on salecompared to last year's model thisyear's version is now dead quiet forcasual tasks like browsing the web andworking on office documents the maindownside with this laptop is it getsextremely warm to the touch when you useit in fact you may want to use anexternal keyboard when you gameif you want a laptop that can steal gameand doesn't feel as warm to the touchstay tuned as I'm about to talk aboutlenovo's new 14-inch slim Pro 9i in acouple of minutes for students lookingfor a laptop for video or photo editingthe MacBook Pro 14 is the one to get itis the only portable high-powered laptopthat can tackle these tasks with littleto no fan noise or a hot feeling chassisit is really unique here plus it isextremely well built it has very longbattery life excellent sound aphenomenal display and the best trackpadif the current model is too expensivefor you you can pick up last year's M1version for a heavy discount which isstill very good if you do want a Windowslaptop for these tasks or as I said youare looking for something that you cando some gaming on the side on lenovo'snew 14-inch slim Pro 9i is absolutelyawesome compared to the Asus G14 that Ijust mentioned the slim pro99 doesn'tget as warm to the touch and its fannoise is significantly quieter the slimPro 9i also has a gorgeous me mini LED165 Hertz refresh rate display the maindownside of that laptop is that it justisn't available to buy right now in theUSA although Lenovo has promised me itwill be available soon for the studentsstudying software development like I didor other disciplines that require ahigher performing machine the bestlaptop to get is the MacBook Pro 14. ithas all the benefits for softwaredevelopers that I mentioned earlier inthe video editing section plus due toits amazing display you'll see a ton ofcode on screen and that is very helpfulfor software development FYI on Mac OS Ialways find I can comfortably see a lotmore code on screen than on similarlysized Windows laptops now if you don'twant to Mac the Asus M book 14x or theslim Pro 9i are both excellent optionsfor software development they are bothplenty powerful and have excellent highresolution displays the main differencebetween the two is that the Zenbook 14xis much cheaper and has a morecomfortable keyboard the pro 9i on theother hand has dedicated graphic 6.finally if you need a budget pick theMacBook Air with M1 from several yearsago is now heavily on sale and is stillvery good on the Windows Side hp'sPavilion plus is my favorite it's a goodall-round laptop with no major issues ithas all the specs you'll need as astudent for a great price just make sureto get the model with a brighter screenits main downside is that it feels cheapand its trackpad is just okay that beingsaid if you can find the Zenbook 14xclose to either of these laptops pricesdefinitely get the Zenbook to round outhere is why we don't recommend thefollowing popular student laptops andsome of these you only really see theissues when you can compare them side byside to better laptops like we did firstthe Samsung Galaxy book 3 Pro 14 it islight and has a lovely screen howeverthe keyboard is not that comfortable itgets very warm to the touch and has Fairnoise plus its battery life is not thatgreat the Dell XPS 13 plus feels highquality and it looks stunningunfortunately its battery life isDreadful and has no physical functionrow and it gets very warm to the touchMicrosoft's surface laptop 5 put up someterrible performance results and it justlooks dated with its large bezels wellthe novos flex 5 has a low qualitydisplay that is

9i andthis is Razer Blade 14 although verynice and I did like it a lot is insanelyexpensive for students and it gets verywarm to the touch while you use it wellthat's it as I said my sheet which Iwill

flipside you'll want a laptop that's largeenough to get real work done that meansyou want to see a good amount of contenton screen now you may think that alaptop screen size is what determineshow much content you can see and it is akey factor but size as you know isn'teverything there are two other factorsthat determine this the first is theclarity of the screen which isdetermined by how many pixels it has toprecisely display content and the secondis how bright the screen is thereforestudents should ideally get a 14 inchlaptop with a resolution higher than1920x1200 and a screen brighter than 400nits which will also help you see thescreen in a bright environment likeusing it close to a window and schoolstend to have lots of Windows if you doneed to compromise on one of thesefactors

students now for thisone my team and I went absolutely nutswe got in pretty much every viablestudent laptop think I'm joking I am notwe tested an epic 15 laptops everythingfrom Apple's MacBook Air to MicrosoftSurface laptop from Asus zenbooks toSamsung Galaxy books you name it wetested it oh and if you're wonderingwhat our experience with student laptopsis between the three of us who worked onthis video we have a combined fiveUniversity degrees now I value your timeso I'm going to very first briefly hiton some important points that you mustbe aware of when picking a laptop forschool then I'm going to get straightinto what you're actually here to seewhich is which laptops we recommend forvarious types of students firstly thelaptop should be small and portableunless we get hit by another virus whichwe all hope we don't students frequentlymove from classroom to classroom plusthey often have group projects wherethey meet in various locations no no onewants to Lug around a heavy Beast of amachine also when you have a laptop openin class you don't want to be the personwho blocks the view to the teacher andthe board for those sitting behind youbecause your laptop is large on the flipside you'll want a laptop that's largeenough to get real work done that meansyou want to see a good amount of contenton screen now you may think that alaptop screen size is what determineshow much content you can see and it is akey factor but size as you know isn'teverything there are two other factorsthat determine this the first is theclarity of the screen which isdetermined by how many pixels it has toprecisely display content and the secondis how bright the screen is thereforestudents should ideally get a 14 inchlaptop with a resolution higher than1920x1200 and a screen brighter than 400nits which will also help you see thescreen in a bright environment likeusing it close to a window and schoolstend to have lots of Windows if you doneed to compromise on one of thesefactors you will survive with only a1920x1200 resolution display we have twoDell XPS 13 plus laptops in the studio ahigh resolution one and one with asubstantially lower resolution displaywe found that you'll see an additionalthree rows of excel with a sharperscreen next as a student you're likelyto be at school for several years you'llwant the laptop to last that means youwant to have enough performance to befuture proof for most students allmodern processors will be good enoughhowever for those doing degrees thathave additional software requirementlike math design video editing softwaredevelopment special note if you'relooking at Intel laptops I'd avoidgetting one with a u-series processorthose processors are not fast enough toFuture proof your purchase if you get anIntel laptop get one with a more beefy Por H series now if you go for an Applelaptop or one with an AMD processor youwon't have to worry about this as theirentire lineup is powerful enough I'llspeak more about these types of studentslater in the video now for all studentstry to get a laptop with 16 gig of RAMsome manufacturers Apple still onlyoffers 8 gig in many of their basemodels which is an absolute disgrace forthe price they charge and when it comesto storage 512 gigs should really be theminimum unless you're starting somethingstorage intensive like film in whichcase you'll probably want one terabyteon the note of longevity you should buyyour laptop from a reputable brandespecially one that offers the abilityto purchase an extended warranty somemanufacturers like Dell even have anupgrade where someone will come to meetyou next business day to fix your laptopmake sure you leave money in your budgetto ensure your laptop has a warrantylong enough to cover your time at schoolnext you'll likely want decent batterylife yes modern classrooms have outletsat every desk but you will facesituations where there aren't enough forexample you're doing group work in aplace with limited Outlets like a coffeestoreapple is your best bet here theirlaptops run circles around Windowslaptops when it comes to battery lifethat being said some PC laptops do havedecent battery life I'll be placing alink to all the laptops we tested in asheet which you can access from the linkbelow on that sheet I've clearly markedout battery test results so you can seewhich laptops are good enough movingalong you don't want a laptop that hasdistracting fan noise no one wants to bethat person who's in class and suddenlyyour laptop's fan spin up and everyonelooks at you and you also don't wantyour laptop to feel uncomfortably warmto the touch that will also bedistracting next you may be tempted tobuy a Chromebook or a tablet with akeyboard instead of a full-blown laptopyes these will work for several types ofstudents with very basic needs but youreally are making things harder onyourself than they need to be moreapplications will run on the standardlaptop if you get one of those devicesyou'll regularly have to findworkarounds for things that just comeeasily to students with a standardlaptop plus if you ever use your laptopon your lap balancing a tablet standit's really not a pleasant experienceand finally make sure to use thediscounts available to you reach out toyour school to find out what discountsthey have and to help you out the sheetI mentioned earlier where I'm listingall the laptops I recommend will havelinks to the cheapest possible pricesthat they are currently available forand if you're strapped for cash I highlyrecommend buying a returned laptop froma reputable seller Best Buy has theiropen box laptops Apple has theirrefurbished program and Dell has theiroutlet store the reason I way prefer youbuy from these over eBay or Craigslistis these laptops will come withwarranties and return policies so in theevent that something doesn't work or youjust don't like the laptop you can dosomething about it plus you may be ableto stack discounts on top of thesealready reduced prices alright before weget into recommendations as mentionedevery laptop that we've tested thatcould be a good student laptop will belisted on the sheet which I'm linkingbelow we will will be keeping that sheetupdated well past this video going liveand I may put some additional laptops orexpanded rationale in there that I don'thave time to cover in this video alrightafter testing tons of different laptopsfrom all major brands the best laptopfor most students right now is the AsusZenbook 14x this laptop has a large 14.5inch display a stunning high resolutionOLED panel 16 gig of RAM and 512 gig ofstorage but none of those positives arewides our number one choice firstly itonly costs a thousand US Dollars andthat's before sales that is a lot lowerthan competitors with similar specssecond if you thought this laptop wouldfeel cheaper than bigger namecompetitors you'd be wrong it feelspremium and has one of the bestkeyboards I've used thirdly unlikecompetitors that use a lower poweredIntel U or P series processors this is avery powerful 8 series processor insideand yet it surprisingly runs quieter andfeels cooler to the touch than otherlaptops with less powerful processors Idon't know how they're doing it but itis amazing fourth even with the powerfulprocessor its battery life is solid atover eight hours for our Netflix videoplayback test our next favorite is theMacBook Air with M2 it has severalbenefits over the Zenbook in that it issignificantly lighter it feels even morepremium it has longer battery life andit has substantially better graphicsperformance so if you plan to dosomething like video editing it's goingto be viable on this laptop but it costsa lot more than the Zenbook for asimilarly spec machine and its CPUperformance is substantially worse forthose students who want to draw on theirlaptop or use it as a tablet we've got atie between lenovo's yoga 9i and the HPSpecter X360 13.5 both offer similarbenefits with the most noticeabledifference being that the yoga 9i has abit of fan noise whereas the SpecterX360 doesn't on the flip side theSpecter X360 isn't the fastest ofmachines although it is good enough forusing office and browsing the websince these laptops are so close to eachother in their overall value propositionI choose which one to get based on whichis on the best sale at the time you buyboth of these laptops regularly go onsubstantial

It suggests that ideally, they should look for a 14-inch laptop with a resolution higher than 1920x1200 and a screen brighter than 400nits. If one factor needs to be compromised on, it can still work with a 1920x1200 resolution display. The text also highlights the importance of processor performance, mentioning that modern processors will be good enough for most students. Additionally, it warns against buying a keyboard-only device, as it may require more workarounds and limitations. Finally, it discusses the pros and cons of specific laptops, such as the Dell XPS 13 plus and Microsoft's Surface Laptop 5, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in terms of performance, design, and battery life.\n",
